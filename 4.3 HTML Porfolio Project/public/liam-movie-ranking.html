 <h1>The best films according to Liam</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 films of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>The Crow</h3>
    <p>It just has everything in it: Action, Love, Fire, Fight scenes, The main character even does a great guitar solo at on point.<br />
        To top it of it has one of the best soundtracks of all time to boot.</p>
 <h3>Predator</h3>
        <p>Such an outstanding performance from one of my favourite actors of all time, Arnold Schwartzenegger.<br />
        Some very quotable lines throughout and full of suspense.</p>
  <h3>Jackass</h3>
        <p>There is just something about several grown men hurting themselves in really silly ways that never fails to make me laugh and cheer me up when I am down.</p>
